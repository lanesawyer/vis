// some quick notes on this deep zoom image format:
// 1. image / tile names are given by {column}_{row}.{format}
// 2. a layer (which may contain multiple tiles) is a folder
// 2.1 that folder contains all the tiles for that layer.
//     layer 0 should contain a single image, 0_0, which is a single pixel!
//     the origin of this tile indexing system is the top left of the image.
//     the spec says that the "size" of a layer is 2*layer... but its closer to pow(2, layer).
//     note also that is more of a maximum size... for example I've seen 9/0_0.jpeg have a size of 421x363, both of those are lower than pow(2,9)=512
//     note also that overlap is ADDED to the tile-size, which is a weird choice, as tileSize seems like it must be a power of 2...🤷‍♀️
