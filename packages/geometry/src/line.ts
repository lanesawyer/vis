/**
 * Given two line segments, determine if they intersect. If they do, we return a 1, otherwise we return a 0. This
 * is so we can count up how many hits there are across a number of lines to determine if a point is inside
 * a polygon.
 *
 * WARNING: For our purposes, we don't consider colinear and coincident line segments to intersect. This is technically
 * incorrect, but is good enough for our usage. If/when this assumption changes, feel free to update the math here.
 *
 * WARNING: Our line segments are interpreted to be half-closed (the start point intersects but not the end point). This is
 * a convenient (and common) practices when we make larger structures out of conjoined line-segments. There is a unit test
 * proving that it is half-closed, so don't be surprised if you change that and tests start failing!
 *
 * This is accomplished by using determinants to compare the two lines in an efficient manner. We don't need
 * the actual point of intersection, just whether or not the lines intersect, so we do not do the final step in the
 * wikipedia article linked below.
 * See more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93line_intersection#Given_two_points_on_each_line_segment
 *
 * @param firstLine First line to compare
 * @param secondLine Second line to compare
 * @returns One if the lines intersect, zero otherwise
